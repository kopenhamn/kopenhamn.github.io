                    <p>For more than 13 years I have been engaged in promotion and sales of products. The last 9 years my main task was to develop the supply and sale of goods from Europe. During this period I formed and trained a team of specialists, increased the range of products and achieved the highest results in terms of sales and profits in the company.</p>

                    <p>I am a responsible and result-oriented team player. In general, I always take an active position and try to get to the heart of the matter to solve the tasks quickly and qualitatively.
                    The desire to develop moves me forward.</p>

                    <p>So, I'm looking for new opportunities to improve my skills and achieve new goals.</p>

                    <p class="text-secondary">* { There ain't nothing I can't do! }</p>

                    <pre>Best regards,
